                <h2><b><center>About Share Market </center></b></h2>
                <div class="h3">The share market is a platform where buyers and sellers come together to trade on 
                     publicly listed shares during specific hours of the day. People often use the terms ‘share market’ 
                      and ‘stock market’ interchangeably. However, the key difference between the two lies in the fact 
                       that while the former is used to trade only shares, the latter allows you to trade various 
                        financial securities such as bonds, derivatives, forex etc.</div>
                <div class="h4"><b><center>Types of Share Markets</center></b></div>
                
                
                <div class="h5">Stock markets can be further classified into two parts:</div>  
                <div class="he">1.Primary markets &#160;    &#160;   &#160;   &#160; 2.Secondary markets</div>
                 
                    
                <div class="h6">Primary Share Markets:  </div>
                <div class="h6a">When a company registers itself for the first time at the stock exchange to raise funds 
                     through shares, it enters the primary market. This is called an Initial Public Offering (IPO), after 
                      which the company becomes publicly registered and its shares can be traded within market 
                       participants.</div>
                <div class="h7">Secondary Market</div> 
                <div class="h7a"> Once a company’s new securities have been sold in the primary market, they are then 
                   traded on the secondary stock market. Here, investors get the opportunity to buy and sell the shares 
                    among themselves at the prevailing market prices. Typically investors conduct these transactions 
                     through a broker or other such intermediary who can facilitate this process.</div>
                <div class="p">Some of the terms of Share Market are :-</div>
                <div class="h8"> BEAR</div>
                <div class="h9">A bear market is when a market experiences prolonged price declines. It typically 
                    describes a condition in which securities prices fall 20% or more from recent highs amid widespread 
                     pessimism and negative investor sentiment.
            
                    Bear markets are often associated with declines in an overall market or index like the S&P 500, but 
                     individual securities or commodities can also be considered to be in a bear market if they 
                      experience a decline of 20% or more over a sustained period of time—typically two months or more. 
                       Bear markets also may accompany general economic downturns such as a recession. Bear markets may 
                        be contrasted with upward-trending bull markets.</div>
                <div class="h10"> BULL</div>
                  
                <div class="h11"> A bull market is the condition of a financial market in which prices are rising or are 
                     expected to rise. The term "bull market" is most often used to refer to the stock market but can be 
                      applied to anything that is traded, such as bonds, real estate, currencies, and commodities.
            
                    Because prices of securities rise and fall essentially continuously during trading, the term "bull 
                     market" is typically reserved for extended periods in which a large portion of security prices are 
                      rising. Bull markets tend to last for months or even years.</div>  
                      <div class="h16"> Offline Trading and What is Online Trading
                       </div>
                      <div class="h17"> Online trading is all about buying and selling shares on the internet sitting in the
                     comfort of your
                     office or your home. You just need to log into your trading account and you can buy and sell shares.
                     Offline trading is trading by visiting your broker’s office or by telephoning your broker.</div>
                      <div class="h18">Trading Account vs Demat Account</div>
                      <div class="h19"> There is an important difference between the two. Trading account is where you execute 
                        your buy and sell trades. The demat account is where your shares are held in custody. When you buy 
                        shares in your trading account, your bank account gets debited and your demat account gets credited. 
                        The reverse is true when you sell shares.</div>
                      <div class="h20">Minimum investment in the Share Market</div>
                      <div class="h21">There is no minimum investment required as you can even buy 1 share of a company. So if 
                        you buy a stock with a market price of Rs.100/- and you just buy 1 share then you just need to invest 
                        Rs.100. Of course, brokerage and statutory charges will be extra.

                        Statutory Charges like GST, stamp duty and STT are imposed by either the central or the state 
                        government. The broker does not get these payments. The broker just collects these on your behalf and 
                        deposits it with the government.</div>
